Since I'm unable to directly access the GitHub page, I'll guide you on how to manage GitHub workflows for your repository.

### Steps to Manage GitHub Workflows

1. **Navigate to Your Repository:**
   Go to your repository on GitHub: [docs-alfresco](https://github.com/AmePelliccia/docs-alfresco).

2. **Access Workflows:**
   Navigate to `.github/workflows` directory.

3. **View Existing Workflows:**
   Open and review existing YAML files to understand the current workflows.

4. **Modify or Create a New Workflow:**
   - **Modify Existing:** Edit the existing YAML files as needed.
   - **Create New:** Create a new YAML file in the workflows directory.

### Example of a Simple Workflow YAML

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

### Committing Changes

1. **Commit Changes Locally:**
   After making changes to the workflow files, commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/your-workflow-file.yml
   git commit -m "Updated GitHub Actions workflow"
   ```

2. **Push Changes:**
   Push your changes to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

### Review Workflow Runs

1. **Check Workflow Runs:**
   Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository to see the status of your workflows.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your GitHub workflows for the `docs-alfresco` repository. If you need specific help with a workflow file or encounter issues, feel free to provide details or snippets, and I'll assist further.
